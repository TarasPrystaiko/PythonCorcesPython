# Membership operators in, not in The operators in and not in test for membership. x in s evaluates to True if x is a member of s, and False otherwise. x not in s returns the negation of x in s. All built-in sequences and set types support this as well as dictionary, for which in tests whether the dictionary has a given key. For container types such as list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, or collections.deque, the expression x in y is equivalent to any(x is e or x == e for e in y).
# str = "Hello"
# print("Hell" in str)
# print("low" not in str)
# lst = [1, 4, 54, 3]
# print(1 in lst)
# print(34 in lst)
# tup = (1, 43, 3, 78)
# print(43 in tup)
# print(656 in tup)
# colors = {'black', 'green', 'red'}
# print('pink' in colors)
# print('pink' not in colors)

# d = {1: "first", 2: "second", 3: "third"}
# print("first" in d)
# print(3 in d)
# print(24 in d)
